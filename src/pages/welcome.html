            <h3>Sunday Services</h3>
            <p>We have services every Sunday Morning at 10:30 AM and every Sunday Evening at 6:00 PM. We sing some hymns, pray together, and our pastor brings a message from the Bible. Our services rarely last longer than one hour and fifteen minutes.</p>

            <p>We meet every Sunday at 9:30 AM for Sunday School. We have Sunday School classes for all ages and stages of life. Please check out our ministries page for more information about a Sunday School class.</p>
            <h3>Midweek Prayer Meeting</h3>
            <p>Every Wednesday at 7:00 PM we meet together for a time of fellowship and prayer. Our Wednesday services are more casual. We hear from a missionary (via video or a prayer letter), Pastor brings a very brief message on prayer, we take prayer requests and then we split up into various groups to pray.
